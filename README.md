# 🤖 ML-Basics: A Beginner's Journey Through Machine Learning

Welcome to **ML-Basics**! This repository is a comprehensive guide to understanding Machine Learning algorithms from the ground up. Each algorithm includes detailed theory, mathematical foundations, and clean Python implementations.

## 📚 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

### How Does Machine Learning Work?

Instead of writing specific rules, we:
1. **Feed data** to an algorithm
2. Let the algorithm **find patterns** in the data
3. Use these patterns to **make predictions** on new, unseen data

### Types of Machine Learning

![Linear Regression Concept](C:/Users/DELL/.gemini/antigravity/brain/b5e1084d-3190-44c2-a558-f297cc6399ef/linear_regression_concept_1766630094709.png)

**1. Supervised Learning** 📊
- Learn from labeled data (input-output pairs)
- Examples: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees
- Use cases: Price prediction, spam detection, image classification

**2. Unsupervised Learning** 🔍
- Find patterns in unlabeled data
- Examples: K-Means Clustering, PCA
- Use cases: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection

**3. Reinforcement Learning** 🎮
- Learn through trial and error with rewards/penalties
- Examples: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks
- Use cases: Game AI, robotics, recommendation systems
